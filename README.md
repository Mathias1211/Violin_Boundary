# Violin_Boundary
The repository contains the NURBS boundary curve of a violin with F-hole presented in the works of Jeremias Arf and Mathias Reichle on SB-IGA.

The NURBS curves are made available either as a Matlab file in the frame of geoPDEs or as a Rhino file. The Rhino files are split into the full violin or half of the violin due to symmetry.
